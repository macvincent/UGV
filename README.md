# Arduino Based Ultrasonic Controlled UGV
This a code written for an Arduino Based Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV). 
The UGV to be controlled based on proximity calculated by readings gotten from an HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor. 
The UGV also makes us of an L923D IC to change the direction of the motors.
